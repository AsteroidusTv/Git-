# Git-

## Git - is a shortcut for doing "git add. , git commit -m "$message" git push" much faster.
### for make it work you need to : 
- [ ] Change the master branch to the one you use by default. 
- [ ] Change the location of the script in the .desktop file. 
- [ ] you must authorize the execution "chmod +x git.sh git.desktop" on git.sh and git.desktop. 

### You can also (On linux) put it in the folder "/home/user/.local/share/application" to make it appear in the menu.

## Tanks for using my script !
