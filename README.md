# Git-

## Git - is a shortcut for doing "git add. , git commit -m "$message" git push" much faster.
### To make it work you need to : 

- [ ] Change the location of the script in the .desktop file. 
- [ ] you must authorize the execution "chmod +x git.sh git.desktop" on git.sh and check the "allow lauching" option for git.desktop. 
- [ ] Check that the files you want to use have been cloned

### You can also (On Ubuntu/Debian) put it in the folder "/home/user/.local/share/application" to make it appear in the application menu.

## Tanks for using my script !
